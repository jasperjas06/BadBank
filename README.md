# BadBank
"Bad Bank" is my MIT capstone application with a front-end. The Bad Bank name refers to the project's earlier iteration where it was a banking application that was not secure (i.e. no login, no administrative privileges). However, we will be using firebase authentication and authorization to create different levels of authorization to turn "Bad Bank" into a more secure bank - a lot like what a really company might use. This project was created in my effort to learn how to build a complete 3-tier application and it will continue to grow as my knowledge of application development grows. It is also designed to be an easy way to show off things I've learned in my Master's Full Stack Development program

## Usage
Create Account - allows you to create a new users for the bank (you can see the users you've created in the AllData tab)
Deposit - allows you to deposit money into your account
Withdraw - allows you to withdraw money from your account
Balance - displays account balance
AllData - for the admin users of the bank - will show all data of all the users of the application
